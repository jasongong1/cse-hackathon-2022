# Counterpoint
Counterpoint is the project for the 2022 CSEsoc Hackathon, our aim is to counter fake news and misinformation by providing a way for users to see the political bias and accuracy of their news sites. As well as providing alternate aritcles from other providers from all political leanings sorted by their accuracy.

## How it works
1. Counterpoint takes in a URL from the user and compares it's parent site to data compilated from Ad Fontes Media. It displays the political bias and accuracy based on this data.
2. It uses a webscrapper to search up similar sites on Google and displays them on the same page with their political bias and accuracy.
